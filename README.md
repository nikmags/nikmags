Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nikhil! I am a dynamic and seasoned fraud, risk, and cyber intelligence expert. I am an iron fist in a velvet glove when it comes to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating cyber fraudsters/threats, contributing to the fortified security posture of both small and large scale organizations. My analytical skills, combined with an extensive knowledge of the  landscape, allow me to effectively dissect complex data and turn it into actionable insights.

I have worked in fast-paced, high-pressure environments, delivering strategic and operational intelligence to protect critical information, buisness, and infrastructure. My professional journey has fortified my understanding of a range of cyber threat actors, techniques, and security controls, as well as the ability to communicate complex security concepts to both technical and non-technical folks.

Being a lifelong learner, I continuously embrace new technologies and methodologies to combat evolving cyber threats. I am always keen to connect with other cybersecurity professionals, seeking opportunities for collaboration, knowledge exchange, and further strengthening the security community.
